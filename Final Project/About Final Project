I investigated the significance of greater proportion of variance on Alumni Score and Awards Score have on the total score 
for determining the world rank of a university, when controlling for Nature and Science Score and PUB Score. 
Since I was a Junior in high school, I have been curious on what factors caused certain universities to be ranked higher than others.
