I took Applied Regression Analysis in the Spring of 2017 under the guidance of Dr.Mahometa. Through the application of software and discussion I learned what forms of data are appropriate to analyze, how to perform the analysis, and how to intrepret the anlaysis. Different forms of analysis that I learned in this class are Correlation, Simple Linear Regression, Sequential Multiple Regression, Multiple Regression: Categorical Predictors, Moderated Multiple Regression: Quantitative by Categorical Interaction, Moderated Multiple Regression: Quantitative by Quantitative Interaction, Mediated Multiple Regression, Segmented Regression, and Logistic Regression. I performed the various regression analysis using statistical packages R and R Studio.
